TL,DR:

Python 3 ONLY

To start a computer:
python3 main.py <filename>
Included programs: fibonacci.
.as8 files are assembly code files. The computer understands only 0's and 1's, so don't load them.


To compile an executable file start "python 3 compiler.py". It will tell you what to do.


##PROGRAMMING##
Assembler for the SAP is very, very rudimentary.

Total memory is 16 bytes.
There are 2 registers: a and b.
The sum of operations is always stored in register a.

Program can consist of maximum 16 lines, each instruction takes exactly 1 byte of memory.

Available instructions:


nop     -   no operation
lda, %x -   load byte from memory address x to register a
add, %x -   add a byte from memory address x to register a and store in register a
sub, %x -   subtract a byte from memory address x to register a and store in register a
sta, %x -   store byte from register a to memory address
ldi, x  -   load 4-bit number x to register a
jmp, %x -   change program counter to memory address x
jc,  %x -   change program counter to memory address x if previous add or sub operation enabled carry flag
jz   %x -   change program counter to memory address x if previous add or sub operation enabled zero flag
out     -   print value of register A to screen
hlt     -   Halt! Hande hoch!



Ben Eater's 8-bit computer emulator.
This is an emulator of a computer featured in Ben Eater's popular video series documenting design and build of
a simple computer based on a SAP-1 design from Albert Paul Malvino's book Digital Computer Electronics.

As of now it works in text-only
